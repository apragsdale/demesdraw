description: Demographic model for American admixture, taken from Browning et al.
  2011. This model extends the Gravel et al. (2011) model of African/European/Asian
  demographic history to simulate an admixed population with admixture occurring 12
  generations ago. The admixed population had an initial size of 30,000 and grew at
  a rate of 5% per generation, with 1/6 of the population of African ancestry, 1/3
  European, and 1/2 Asian.
