description: A ten population model of out-of-Africa, including two pulses of Denisovan
  admixture into Papuans, and several pulses of Neandertal admixture into non-Africans.
  Most parameters are from Jacobs et al. (2019), Table S5 and Figure S5. This model
  is an extension of one from Malaspinas et al. (2016), thus some parameters are inherited
  from there.
